description: 'Bot Potts, via M.A.D.Gallery Working out of his one-man workshop inside a mid-19th century barn, artist Bob Potts ( previously) builds wonderous kinetic sculptures that replicate the motions of birds, fish, or other natural motions. The 72-year-old artist utilizes hand-crafted gears, levers, cranks, and chains to create these minimalist pieces that are focused solely on motion rather than ornamentation.'
